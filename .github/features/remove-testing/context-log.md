# REMOVE TESTING - Context Engineering Log

## Context Strategy Decisions
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-21 Remove Testing Feature

### Selected Context Strategy: WRITE + SELECT + ISOLATE
- **WRITE CONTEXT**: Maintaining implementation logs in `.github/remove-testing/`
- **SELECT CONTEXT**: Using file_search and read_file for testing-related files
- **COMPRESS CONTEXT**: Focused scope on testing removal only
- **ISOLATE CONTEXT**: Single-agent approach for targeted removal

### Memory Patterns Identified
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unity framework, native env, test files
- **Risk Assessment**: High risk due to loss of automated validation
- **Simplification Goal**: Reduce project complexity significantly
- **Hardware Focus**: Move to 100% hardware-based validation

### Context Sources
- Primary: `test/test_slot_manager.cpp`, `platformio.ini`
- Secondary: Project structure analysis
- Documentation: Build guides and development workflow

### Optimization Notes
- Focus on clean removal without breaking production code
- Preserve all src/ functionality completely
- Validate build process after each change step
- Document risk acceptance explicitly
